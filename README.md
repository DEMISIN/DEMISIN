not keen on c+h but you can sit next to me (?)

i rarely play pt anymore but you will usually find me sitting on the stump underneath mines in 18+ with my boyfriend. if we sit too close to you or near you; we're probably trying to sit close to our stump.

league of legends, projectmoon, genshin impact, yugioh & other stuff; i don't condone the actions of the parent companies behind those media

no pt boundaries just don't colorpick me & my boyfriend's ponies & don't be a weirdo
